        The Poptart. A staple in many western homes as a quick and easy snack that's sweet and delicious.

    <p> This collection of flavors acted as a bombshell on the breakfast market and were an instant hit among the kiddies.
        The Simplistic nature of being able to eat breakfast in seconds all from this tiny sugary little rectangle made it a very attractive option for consumers.

    <h2> Too Bad They SUCK</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately, every single other flavor besides, S'mores has sucked by an unbelievable amount.
        Nothing has com even remotely close to replicated that sweet sweet chocolate marshmallow combination that delicious S'mores fufills. It's  truly a shame, but we mustn't complain, for the S'mores Poptart is so delicious, so perfect, so... tarty, that it makes up for the failures of it's Poptart siblings. </p>
